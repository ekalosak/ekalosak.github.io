<h3>A non-Euclidean Game of Life</h3>
<p>
The Game of Life can be played on a graph, specifically a <code>nx.watts_strogatz_graph(30, 8, 0.1)</code>:
<br><br>
<img

  alt="game of life on a tutte graph"
  class="center"
/>
<br><br>
The Game of Life has few rules:
<ul>
<li>live nodes with 2 or 3 live neighbors live to the next step</li>
<li>dead nodes with 3 live neighbors spring to life in the next step</li>
<li>all other nodes die in the next step</li>
</ul>
Harsh, but principled.
<br><br>

Although it's typically played on a 2D infinite Euclidean grid, there's no reason the rules can't to non-euclidean
topologies.
<br><br>
Try it yourself: <code>python -m nx3d life nogui watt</code><br>Requires nx3d 22.10.4 or greater.
