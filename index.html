<h1>How to Bevy when your macbook can't</h1>
<p>
  <u>A guide to productive game development in Rust when your machine can't keep up.</u>
</p>
<h4>Some personal motivation</h4>
<p>
  What better way to get better at a programming language than to write a game
  in it?  It's fun, creative, and complex enough to get you below the surface
  level language features. Rust makes me think, and (unrelated to the rest of
  this post but) <a href="https://pola.rs/">Polars</a> alone is enough of a
  reason for an MLE to get involved.<br> So - Rust, games.<br><br>
  On the search for a framework,
  <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> stood out.<br>
  From their homepage, Bevy is a "refreshingly simple data-driven game engine
  built in Rust". It uses native structs and has a mental model that is pretty
  easy to "get dangerous" with.<br>
  Clean, crisp, awesome!<br><br>
  But not so fast.<br>
  My ancient macbook can't run any of even the simplest
  examples from Bevy's <a href="https://bevyengine.org/examples/">extensive
  list</a>. Great sad. After a few months ruminating on this issue, trying
  other projects here and there to salve the Bevy-shaped ache in my brain, this
  time around I found some
  success.<br><br>
  By some miracle (i.e. with lots of help from blog posts by those more skilled
  than I,) I found a productive remote development workflow. With that ethos at
  heart, I'll leave this attempt at a guide in hopes that it helps at least one
  other interested tinkerer.<br>
  On with the tech!
</p>

<h1>I. Introduction</h1>
<h3>I.a. Why: My ancient macbook can’t do Bevy dev locally.</h3>
<p>
  See the related GitHub issues in the sources below for details on the shader
  translation error necessitating a workaround.
</p>
<h3>I.b. Goal: <i>productive</i> Bevy dev on a remote box.</h3>
<p>
  It's not as straightforward as forwarding a tty over ssh - game development
  requires graphics.
</p>
<h3>I.c. Alternatives: tried (1-3) or considered (4-6):</h3>

<ol>
  <li>wasm
    <ul>
      <li>easy on a remote box: compile, transpile, serve a webpage; works!</li>
      <li>but way to slow compile cycle for productive dev</li>
      <li>dyamic linking not supported for bevy wasm (see <a href="https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/platforms/wasm.html#additional-caveats">Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book</a>.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>cross-platform compile
    <ul>
      <li>simply doesn’t work on Ubuntu with `rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin`</li>
      <li>would have to have an scp in the loop</li>
      <li>who knows how that looks with DLLs in the mix</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>x11 forwarding
    <ul>
      <li>native development loop</li>
      <li>complexity of solution</li>
      <li>visual lag when running game</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>compile on mac1.metal ec2 instance
    <ul>
      <li>those things are $1/hr, no thanks</li>
      <li>suffers from same other issues as the transpile alternative</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>buy a new macbook
    <ul>
      <li>no, too expensive & wasteful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>dual boot linux
    <ul>
      <li>attractive option but I don’t mess with my command center like that</li>
      <li>I have other projects going in the mac native environment, context switching would be painful</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1>tl;dr - simple remote desktop implementation</h1>
<p>
  ⏱about 1 hour, assuming you have an AWS account already.<br>
  💵less than $0.25; hourly t2.large was $0.1 at time of writing.</br>
  🏎
  <ol>
    <li>On remote Ubuntu t2.large, install:
      <ol>
        <li>x11 requirements</li>
        <li>rust build requirements</li>
        <li>vnc requirements</li>
        <li>desktop environment^ this will take 30 minutes</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Open an SSH connection and bind 5901 on remote to localhost.</li>
    <li>Start the VNC.</li>
    <li>Connect to remote desktop server with Screen Sharing.</li>
    <li>Build and launch the Bevy example.</li>
  </ol>
  🏁
</p>

<h3>I  🍳 Launch Ubuntu t2.large on AWS</h3>
<img src="static/blog-5/aws-ec2-console.png">
<p>
  I’ve found it’s ok, but you could go for an xlarge or c family and be happier.
  I put 64GiB EBS on it.
  All other default options are ok, just make sure you have SSH access in the SG.
</p>

<h3>II  📦 Install dependencies on remote host</h3>
<p>
  In corresponding order to the tl;dr:
  <code>
    <pre>
```sh
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y xorg libxkbcommon-x11-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev libudev-dev
sudo apt install -y tigervnc-standalone-server tigervnc-xorg-extension tigervnc-viewer
sudo apt install -y lxde
```
    </pre>
  </code>
  Once everything is installed <em>reboot the Ubuntu instance</em>.
</p>

<h3>III     📡 Start the VNC server</h3>
<p>
  Open an SSH connection to remote host and bind the 5901 port to localhost.
  <code><pre>
```sh
ssh ubuntu@ec2-[network-addr] -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901
```
  </code></pre>
  Then, on the remote box, start the VNC server.<br>
  First, you will need to set a password.
  <code><pre>
```sh
vncpasswd
vncserver -xstartup /usr/bin/lxsession
```
  </code></pre>
This is the expected output for starting the VNC server:
</p>
<img src="static/blog-5/terminal-vncserver-start.png">
<p>
  You can see the vnc servers with<br><code>`vncserver -list`</code><br> and kill with<br><code>`vncserver -kill :1`</code><br>
  Go ahead and leave this terminal with the SSH connection open.
</p>

<h3>IV    🖥 Connect to the remote desktop</h3>
Run the built-in “Screen Sharing” remote desktop app.<br>
Put in “localhost:5901” and the password you put into `vncpasswd`.
<img src="static/blog-5/screen-sharing-launch.png">


<h3>V    🏗 Build and launch the Bevy example</h3>
<p>
  Reproduced with modification from <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/#try-the-examples">the bevy example list</a>:
  <code><pre>
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy
cd bevy
cargo run --example bloom_3d
```
  </code></pre>
  The expected result and endpoint of the runbook is:

</p>

Apx A: Tricks
- XRandR error is solved with `ssh -Y` rather than `ssh -X`
    - As long as you are only one with access to remotehost, this is fine.

Apx B: Errors remain
3d rendering library complains but never ended up bricking anything:
- “MESA: error: ZINK: failed to choose pdev”
- “libEGL warning: egl: failed to create dri2 screen”
