<h2>How to Bevy when your macbook can't</h2>
<h3>April 30, 2024</h3>
<h4>Some personal motivation</h4>
<p>
  What better way to learn more about a language than to write a game in it?
  It's fun, creative, and complex enough to get you below the surface level
  language features. Rust is cool, I'm skilling up in it, (unrelated but)
  <a href="https://pola.rs/"></a>Polars</a> alone is enough of a reason for an
  MLE to get involved. And on the search for a framework,
  <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy</a> stood out.<br>
  Bevy is, from their homepage, a "refreshingly simple data-driven game engine
  built in Rust". It uses native structs and has a mental model that is pretty
  easy to "get dangerous" with. Awesome!<br><br>
  But not so fast. My ancient macbook can't run any of even the simplest
  examples from Bevy's extensive list. Great sad. After a few months ruminating
  on this issue, trying other projects here and there to salve the Bevy-shaped
  ache in my heart, I decided to bash my head against it.<br>
  By some miracle (i.e. with lots of blog posts by those more skilled than I) it worked.

<h4>Introduction</h4>
Goal: Bevy dev on a remote box
Why: My ancient macbook canâ€™t do Bevy dev locally
Alternatives:
- wasm
    - easy on a remote box: compile, transpile, serve a webpage; works!
    - but way to slow compile cycle for productive dev
    - dyamic linking not supported for bevy wasm
- transpile
    - simply doesnâ€™t work on Ubuntu with `rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin`
    - would have to have an scp in the loop
    - who knows how that looks with DLLs in the mix
- x11 forwarding
    - native development loop
    - complexity
    - lag
- buy a new macbook
    - no, too expensive & wasteful
- compile on mac1.metal ec2 instance
    - those things are $1/hr, no thanks
- dual boot linux
    - attractive option but I donâ€™t mess with my command center like that
